## Project Overview

Initiated and developed by Pleasurecruise, a the Computer Science (2+2) program student of Class of 2027, and established on June 15, 2024.

This project primarily consists of three parts: the server side, the mini-program side, and the management side.

**Under Development**

## Notes

Since features such as order placement and user information retrieval involve value-added business reviews and require corresponding business licenses, some testing is conducted on the WeChat Mini-Program test account.

Version 1.0 of the mini-program is now live! Search for `CPU Wall` on WeChat or scan the mini-program code below to experience it.
